# DownloadsOrganizer
This was a short script I wrote to clean out and sort my downloads directory by extensions, or group several extensions into one group

# required modifications
In the DownloadOrganizer.py file, a user will need to replace the downloadDir string with the path to their downloads directory, or any directory you want to be sorted

Also, you must replace the destinationDir to the directory you want your downloads directories files moved to
